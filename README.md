Traffic flow prediction

Traffic Flow Prediction: Developed a predictive model to analyze traffic patterns and forecast congestion using real-time and historical data. Helped optimize traffic management, reduce congestion, and support smart city planning through data-driven insights.

# Project Introduction

This project aims to analyze traffic flow data to identify patterns, predict traffic conditions, and provide actionable insights for stakeholders. The analysis involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning models to achieve these objectives.

A Random Forest Classifier is used for model training.

The model’s performance is evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
